# -SRNT
Project Serenity - (#SRNT) is a platform to provide information about the nearest help for people in difficult life situations.

We collect, verify, systematize and provide open access to the data collected in the framework of the project.

Using artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, we in the #SRNT project build predictive models for effective interaction with victims.
Project #SRNT generates independent incident reports detailing where and when help is requested. Guided by SoftPower and OpenData, #SRNT publishes publicly available analytics and sends reports to government and public organizations interested in the information.

The #SRNT project is completely free!
